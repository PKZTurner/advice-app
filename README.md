## Overview

Advice Generator App
This app generates random pieces of advice from the Advice Slip JSON API with every button click. It displays the advice text and a unique advice ID number for each quote.

# Getting Started

To use this app, simply clone or download the repository to your local machine and open the index.html file in a web browser.

# Usage

Click the "Roll the dice" button to generate a new piece of advice. The advice text will appear in the quote section and the advice ID will be displayed in the header.

# Technologies

This app was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The advice quotes were fetched from the Advice Slip API using the fetch() method in JavaScript.

# Credits

This app was created by me, but was prompted by the lovely folks at frontendmentor.io; this promp is an awesome project for learning web development! The advice quotes were provided by the Advice Slip API.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## My process

In creating the advice app, I began by reviewing the functional requirements and style specifications. This helped me to understand the purpose and goals of the app, as well as the design elements that needed to be included. From there, I researched and selected appropriate colors, typography, and other style elements to create a cohesive design that aligned with the specifications.

Next, I used semantic HTML and CSS3 with flexbox to build the layout of the app, ensuring that it aligned with the design images provided. Finally, I wrote JavaScript code to fetch the advice API and manipulate the DOM to display the advice quote and number on each button click. By following this process, I was able to create a functional and visually appealing app that met most if not all of the specified requirements.

Overall, the key steps in whipping up the advice app included understanding the requirements, researching appropriate design elements, building the layout with HTML and CSS, and using JavaScript to fetch and display the advice quotes. This process helped me to stay organized and focused on the key objectives of the project, while also allowing me to be creative and experiment with different design elements!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Advice Slip API

### What I learned

During this activity, I learned a lot about how to fetch data from an API using JavaScript. I also learned how to manipulate the DOM in order to dynamically update content on a webpage.

One thing that I found particularly helpful was learning how to use the fetch() function to send GET requests to an API and handle the returned data using promises. This allowed me to retrieve information from the API and display it on the page without needing to reload the entire page.

I also learned how to use event listeners to detect when a user interacts with a webpage, and how to use CSS classes to apply animations to HTML elements. Although I encountered some challenges with the animation, it was helpful to learn how to apply these effects to make the page more visually appealing.

Overall, this activity gave me a good introduction to working with APIs and using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM. I look forward to applying these concepts in future projects!

### Continued development

To continue to improve this project, I would like to explore adding a fade-in and fade-out animation for the advice text. This would add a nice visual touch and improve the overall user experience. Additionally, I may explore ways to add more customization options, such as the ability to change the background color or font size. Overall, I'm excited to continue to develop this project and add new features to make it even better.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.toptal.com/designers/htmlarrows/symbols/die-face-5/) - where I found the dice HTML code.
- [Example resource 2](https://codepen.io/ibrahimjabbari/pen/DPQaWB) - This is an amazing pen on codepen.io! Had a ton of inspiring horizontal rules - ended up using one of 'em!
- [Example resource 3](https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/css-round-button/#:~:text=To%20create%20a%20rounded%20button,ems%2C%20rems%2C%20percentages%20etc.) - Gained a ton of inspiration from the buttons on this blog as well. I definitely recommend taking a gander.
- [Example resource 4](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) - Some documentation on the .fetch() method. this was a life-saver when it came to grabbing the API goodies!
